#### Here are all my homeworks from the courses I made, "Intro to Python" from IT Factory.

On the topics covered into this project I can mention:
  - variables and data types
  - operators and flow control(if else, switch
  - data structures (array, map, list)
  - loops (while, for)
  - functions
  - oop basics.
